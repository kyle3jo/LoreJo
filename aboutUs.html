                <h2>Founding</h2>
                <p>
                    In the ever-increasing demand for deep lore for games and media, Mr Squiggles (Dave Smith), founded “Lore.jo” in his garage to help sell 
                    and develop e-books that explores the mysteries of deep lore within fictional worlds. Over time the business became more and more popular, 
                    striking a chord with people that loved to be immersed into the deepest parts of their favourite universes.
                </p>

                    Lore.jo provides in-depth and detailed background lores of games and media in an e-book format. Lore.jo also provides revisions of books 
                    that the details are incorrect. These revisions can be sold at a discounted price if the owner owns the original. Additional volumes of 
                    e-book will be produced if the game or media franchise is expanded upon by the developers and creator.
